//What is JavaScript? (Links to an external site.)
It is used to make the web look alive by adding motion to it.
To be more precise, it’s a scripting language that let’s you implement complex and
beautiful things/design on web pages. When you notice a web page doing more than
just sit there and gawk at you, you can bet that the web page is using JavaScript.
*It makes web pages more interactive by adding motions and graphics
*It is an Interpreted language which means that you don’t require a compiler to run JavaScript
*JavaScript is mainly a client-side scripting language

//Why use jQuery? (Links to an external site.)
Simplifies JavaScript: It simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling for
rapid web development
Event handling: jQuery offers an effective manner to capture a wide variety of
events, such as a user clicking on a link, without the need to clutter the HTML code
Lightweight: jQuery is a compact, lightweight library of about 19KB in size
Animations: It comes with plenty of built-in animation effects which you can use
in your web app to make it more interactive


//What is jQuery? (Links to an external site.)
jQuery is an efficient & fast JavaScript Library created by John Resig in 2006.
The motto of jQuery is write less, do more, which is very apt because it’s
functionality revolves around simplifying each and every line of code.

//Install jQuery (Links to an external site.)
Connect jQuery to HTML page. Link js page under jQuery link.
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js" type
  ="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/quilt.js"></script>

//The Document Object Model(DOM) (Links to an external site.)
DOM is a tree structure of the various HTML elements.
<html> is the ancestor of all the other DOM elements
The <head> and <body> elements are descendants of <html>
<title> is child of <head>
The <h1> & <p> elements are children of <body> and <html>

//jQuery Selectors (Links to an external site.)
jQuery Selectors are used to select and manipulate HTML elements by using the “$()” function.
In regular JavaScript we have functions like document.getElementById, querySelectorAll, getElementByClass
and so many other elaborate functions to do this. But in jQuery the “$()” function replaces all of these functions.
